# synthetic_nn dataset

Synthetic data â€” a two-dimensional process, generated from a GP with Neural 
Network kernel.

First experiments show that it's rather hard to train the model, at least for 
this dataset. Now I first train the method with lr=0.1 for 50 epochs and then 
train it again with lr=0.01 for 50 more epochs. And currently I use a very simple
NN.

- Linear Embedding to dim d=2 achieves 0.86 r2 score.
