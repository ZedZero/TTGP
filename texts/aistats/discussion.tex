We proposed TT-GP method for scalable inference in Gaussian process models
for regression and classification.  The proposed method is capable of using
billions of inducing inputs, which is impossible for existing methods. This allows us to improve the
performance over state-of-the-art both with standard and deep kernels
on several benchmark datasets.
Further, we believe that our model provides a more natural way of learning deep
kernel functions than the existing approaches since it doesn't require any
specific modifications of the GP model and allows working with high-dimensional
DNN embeddings.
 
Our preliminary experiments showed that TT-GP is inferior in terms of
uncertainty quantification compared to existing methods. We suspect that the
reason for this is restricting Kronecker structure for the covariance matrix $\Sigma$. 
We hope to alleviate this limitation by using Tensor Train format for $\Sigma$ 
and corresponding approximations to it's determinant.

As a promising direction for future work we consider training TT-GP
with deep kernels incrementally, using the variational approximation
of posterior distribution as a prior for new data. We also find it interesting
to try using the low-dimensional embeddings learned by our model for transfer 
learning. Finally, we are interested in using the proposed method for structured prediction,
where TT-GP could scale up GPstruct approaches (\citet{bratieres2015}) and allow using
deep kernels. 
%Finally, we want to explore the performance of our model in different practical
% applications including hyper-parameter optimization.
