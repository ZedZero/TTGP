In this section we first compare the proposed TT-GP\footnote{for TT-GP we use our implementation available at
\url{https://anonymized-link}} method with SVI-GP (\citet{hensman2013}) on regression tasks and KLSP-GP
(\citet{hensman2015}) on binary classification tasks using standard RBF kernel
functions. Then, we test the ability of our method to learn
expressive deep kernel functions and compare it with SV-DKL
(\citet{wilson2016stochastic}).

\subsection{Standard Kernels}

For testing our method with standard covariance functions we used a range of
classification and regression tasks from UCI and LIBSVM archives and the
Airline dataset, that is popular for testing scalable GP models
(\citet{hensman2013}, \citet{hensman2015}, \citet{wilson2016stochastic},
\citet{cutajar2016}).

For SVI-GP and KLSP-GP we used the implementations provided in GPfLow
(\citet{GPflow2016}). For Airline dataset we provide results reported in
the original paper (\citet{hensman2015}). For our experiments we use a cluster of Intel Xeon E5-2698B v3 CPUs having $16$ cores and $230$ GB
of RAM.

For YearPred, EEG and covtype datasets we used a $d$-dimensional linear embedding inside the RBF kernel for TT-GP, as the number $D$ of features makes it
impractical to set inducing inputs on a grid in a $D$-dimensional space in this case.

Table \ref{se_results} shows the results on different regression and
classification tasks. We can see, that TT-GP is able to achieve better
predictive quality on all datasets except EEG. We also note that the
method is able to achieve good predictive performance with linear
embedding, which makes it practical for a wide range of datasets.

\subsection{Deep Kernels}

  \subsubsection{Representation learning}
  We first explore the representation our model learns for data on the small
  Digits\footnote{\url{http://scikit-learn.org/stable/auto_examples/datasets/plot_digits_last_image.html}}
  dataset containing $n = 1797$ $8 \times 8$ images of handwritten digits. We
  used a TT-GP with a kernel based on a small fully-connected neural network
  with two hidden layers with $50$ neurons each and $d = 2$ neurons in the output
  layer to obtain a $2$-dimensional embedding. We trained the model to classify
  the digits to $10$ classes corresponding to different digits.
  Fig. \ref{digits_embedding},a shows the learned embedding. We also trained the same
  network standalone, adding another layer with $10$ outputs and softmax
  activations. The embedding for this network is shown in fig. \ref{digits_embedding},b.

    and BN means batch normalization (\citet{ioffe2015}).}

  We can see that the stand-alone DNN with linear classifiers is unable
  to learn a good $2$-dimensional embedding.
  On the other hand, using a flexible GP classifier our
  model learns to group objects of the same class into compact regions.

  \subsubsection{Classification tasks}
  To test our model with deep kernels we used Airline,
  CIFAR-10 (\citet{krizhevsky2009}) and
  MNIST (\citet{lecun1998}) datasets. The corresponding DNN architecture is shown in Table~\ref{deep_architecture}. For CIFAR-10 dataset we also use standard data augmentation techniques with random cropping of $24 \times 24$
  parts of the image, horizontal flipping, randomly adjusting brightness and contrast. In all experiments we also add a BN without trainable mean and
  variance after the DNN output layer to project the outputs into the region
  where inducing inputs are placed. We use $m_0 = 10$ inducing inputs
  per dimension and set TT-ranks of $\mu$ to $r = 10$ for all three datasets. For experiments with convolutional neural networks, we
  used Nvidia Tesla K80 GPUs to train the model.

  Table~\ref{deep_results} shows the results of the experiments for our TT-GP
  with DNN kernel and SV-DKL. Note, that the comparison
  is not absolutely fair on CIFAR-10 and MNIST datasets, as we didn't use
  the same exact architecture and preprocessing as \citet{wilson2016stochastic}.
  On Airline we used the same exact architecture and preprocessing as
  SV-DKL, and TT-GP achieves a higher accuracy on this dataset.

  We also provide results of stand-alone DNNs for comparison. We used the
  same networks that were used in TT-GP kernels with the last linear layers replaced
  by layers with $C$ outputs and softmax activations. Overall, we can see, that
  our model is able to achieve good predictive performance,
  improving the results of standalone DNN on Airline and MNIST.

  We train all the models from random initialization without pretraining. We also
  tried using pretrained DNNs as initialization for the kernel of our TT-GP model,
  which sometimes leads to faster convergence, but does not improve the final
  accuracy.
